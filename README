Here it is, by request!


Patch tested against 3.4.0 through 3.5.0

Works with current pacman-git, as of 16 Mar 2011


A PKGBUILD is available in the AUR: "pacman-panis-git"


To enable, add 'ILovePanis' to a line by itself in 
the [options] section of /etc/pacman.conf



And for the record, I don't LovePanis
